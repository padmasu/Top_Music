### Project Title
Analyzing Music Data

### Description
I'll be using a dataset from data.world to create a Power BI dashboard to see the relationship between Loudness and overall popularity of a song. 
I'll be mostly targeting a few genres. 

I'll also be creating a RandomForest regresssion model to predict popularity.

### Credits
Checkout data.world.
Specific dataset I retrieved was "Hot 100 Audio Features".
